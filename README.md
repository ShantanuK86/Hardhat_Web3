 Does some unit testing in Hardhat and learn about deploying Smart contracts.
## Unit Testing in hardhat
 Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest portions of codes that can be tested, known as Units, are individually tested to check if they
 perform as intended.Unit testing in terminal can be done through command-'npx hardhat test'.
 I have provided whole code , athough it can be tested on various Functionalities.
 
 1. Testing the Transfer Functionality(owner to addr1)
 2. Testing the Transfer Functionality(tokens from addr1 to addr2).
 3. Testing the Transfer Functionality - Negative Case Test(error handling).
